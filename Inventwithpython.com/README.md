### Bagels
In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.

### Bitmap Message
This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and all other characters are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image you’d like. The binary simplicity of the space-or-message-characters system makes it good for beginners. Try experimenting with different messages to see what the results look like!

### Caesar cipher
The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It encrypts letters by shifting them over by a certain number of places in the alphabet. We call the length of shift the key. For example, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm.

### Cho - Han
Cho-han is a dice game played in gambling houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice are rolled in a cup, and gamblers must guess if the sum is even (cho) or odd (han). The house takes a small cut of all winnings. The simple random number generation and basic math used to determine odd or even sums makes this project suitable for beginers like me.
